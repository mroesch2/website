This website was created using Python, Django, and CSS via Visual Studio Code. 

I created this website as a way to teach myself web design since it was never somethingI had the opportunity to learn in college. With COVID keeping us all stuck at home, it seemed like the perfect thing to do in my spare time to help expand my coding skills and knowledge.
