                        CSS, and HTML. Graduting and entering the job market during COVID has been difficult so I decided it
                        was the perfect time to start teaching myself some new areas of software developement. Currently, I am leanring
                        web developement as well as C#/.NET. </p>

                        <p>I was born and raised in the midwest and began my college career as a fashion design major in Los Angeles.
                        Realizing fashion design wasn't for me, I returned home and stumbled upon computer science 
                        through my love of space exploration. I enrolled at Tennessee Tech and spent my free time working at Russell
                        Stover Chocolates (yes, I ate A LOT of candy).</p> 

                        <p>I'm an avid hiker in my spare time and have hiked at most state parks in Tennessee. I am also a third wave
                        coffee enthusiast and perpetual beginner photographer.</p>
